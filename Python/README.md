# Python Coding Note

### Recursion:

**When to use it?**

    1. When we can easily breakdown a problem into similar subproblem. 
    2. When we are fine with extra overhead (both time and space) that comes with it.
    3. When we need a quick working solution instead of efficient one. 
    4. when traverse a tree. 
    5. WHen we use memoization in recursion. 

**When avoid it?**
    
    1. If time and space compliexity matters.
    2. Recursion uses more memory. If use embedded memory. For instance, an application that takes more memory in the phone is not efficient.
    3. Recursion can be slow.
